# Triangular-Mesh-Himalaya
Set of routines for generating triangular mesh of the Himalayan megathrust by using delaunay triangulation method. Also, this considers the Slab 2.0 model of USGS to define the downdip edge of the megathrust. This triangular mesh code may work for other east-west and north-south oriented megathrusts (may need bit of tweaking)
